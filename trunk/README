BUGS
Can be reported at:
http://code.google.com/p/knittingchartmaker/issues/list

Please be as descriptive as possible, including how to reproduce the bug if possible.
Also, it would be helpful if the log file was attached with the bug report.


KNOWN ISSUES
1. There can be some problems when picking more obscure colours for yarns.
The problem would be that after saving a chart, it would not again reopen.
WORKAROUND: If you open the save file you should see a section near the top
called "yarns". In there should be details of the yarns you used. Try changing
the name value of the yarn's colour to something more simple, e.g. "#FF0000",
and try loading it again.

2. Another colour related one, this would be that again, with more obscure colours
the exported SVG may not match the colour you chose the the ChartMaker. 

FEATURES TO BE IMPLENTED:
1. Choice in placement of the row numbers (left/right side), choice in column numbers (yes/no). For now these can be edited by opening the SVG in Inkscape.
2. Exporting as PNG/JPG
3. Option of creating a key when exporting.
4. Ability to change stitch names for the key.
5. Option of changing grid color.
